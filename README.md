## Try these first with Excel
1. Get the movielens dataset:
https://github.com/rebeccabilbro/hathor/blob/master/data/u.item    
2. Open the file and determine the answers to the following questions:
  - What's the oldest movie in the list?
  - What's the newest movie in the list?
  - How many unique movie titles are there?
  - Which titles have been repeated?
  - Of the repeated titles, which are remakes? Which are duplication errors?
  - How many movies were released in December?
  - Which movies contain an animal in the title?
  - Which movies have a title longer than 5 words?
3. Then try answering the questions using Pandas.

## Pandas
Pandas is an open source library that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for Python.

## Getting Started
If you have Anaconda, you should already have all the requirements. Else...

### With pip (Python 2.x)
```
$ pip install jupyter
$ pip install matplotlib
$ pip install pandas
$ git clone https://github.com/rebeccabilbro/hathor.git
$ cd hathor
$ jupyter notebook
```

### With pip3 (Python 3.x)
```
$ pip3 install jupyter
$ pip3 install matplotlib
$ pip3 install pandas
$ git clone https://github.com/rebeccabilbro/hathor.git
$ cd hathor
$ jupyter notebook
```
